## Randomutil: A User-Friendly C++ Library for Random Data Generation

Randomutil streamlines generating diverse random data in your C++ projects. It offers a comprehensive set of functions to create:

<strong>Random Characters</strong>: Produce random characters of various types: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

<strong>Random Strings</strong>: Craft strings of a specified length containing either a specific character type or a mix of different types.

<strong>Random Keys</strong>: Generate unique key strings based on a chosen character type, separated by a chosen separator character.

<strong>Randomly Filled Arrays</strong>: Fill arrays with random numbers or random words of a specific length.

Benefits:

Realistic Simulations: Generate realistic scenarios by mimicking real-world data patterns.
Robust Testing: Create random inputs to thoroughly test your code's robustness.
Flexibility: Choose from various character types and control the length of generated strings/words.
Ease of Use: Simple and intuitive function calls make generating desired random data effortless.
Efficiency: The library efficiently leverages standard C++ random number generation techniques.
